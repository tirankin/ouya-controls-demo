Hello, World!

This is my first Git project and my first OUYA project, so know going in that it's going to be a clumsy ride.

ouya-controls-demo is intended to be a brief little OUYA app that displays output corresponding precisely to user input.

The intent is that you can pick up the controller, start the app, and find out exactly how the OUYA interprets your actions.

This is meant for use by developers who want to know exactly how responsive the controller is before they start designing their own input framework.
